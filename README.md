### Sponsored by [Teehee Dental Works](https://teehee.sg/)

**1408Hyper-2024VRC-Code** was designed with portability in mind - we understand that situations can quickly change at any competition.  

Our code is hot-swappable, making heavy use of **abstract classes** and **templates**
to allow for us to rapidly change and test different pieces of code when time is of the essence.
